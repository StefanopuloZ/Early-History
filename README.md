# Early History

This repo contains early develomplent history of some of my projects that now have their own repos. It also contains some practice and school work. It's sole purpose is to provide info in my early development path and serve as a proof that my work is really my own and not someone's else.

Why it is here and like this? For some reason I thought it would be best to have all of my work together as I did not think, at that time, that some of them would serve presentation purposes other then for my professor to see. I did not spend much time thinking about portfolio as I have spent all of my time and energy studying.

So here it is. I've arhived it and left it as it was. Not everything is in English and some things there should never be put in portfolio as a 4-year old child could do them, but they, nontheles, represent something I've put myself in to fanatically.

Most things that are presentable here, have their own repositories and websites.
